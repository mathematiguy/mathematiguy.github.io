Caleb Moses is a PhD Student in computer science, supervised by Prof Jackie Cheung and Prof Noelani Arista at McGill University. He is a member of the Reasoning and Learning Lab at McGill University, and of Mila Quebec, the AI research institute based in Montreal.

His research interests focus on the application of artificial intelligence to Language Revitalisation of Indigenous languages, in particular te reo Māori, the language of the Indigenous people of New Zealand.

Caleb hails from Te-Hokianga-Nui-ā-Kupe, the "great returning place of Kupe", the legendary Polynesian navigator. His Iwi (tribe) is Ngāpuhi-Nui-Tonu, and his Hapū (sub-tribe) is Te Mahurehure.
